1. Install Pajek on lab machine
2. Testing and debug: input graph into a visualizer and see our result

1, Create network into a txt file, ->txt file format output can be used for software to visualize it
2, Run cases for test(different value of alpha, etc.) ->
3, always keep track of percentage of agents eliminated
4, percentage of cooperators left in network (in cooperator cluster)  -Amount of clusters left?
5, pick colors for cooperator and defector
6, use small network first to test the code
7,Done the coding part by Tuesday and start testing
8,
