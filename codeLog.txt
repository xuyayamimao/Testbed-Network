2. Created PlayPDG class

Ziya&James 6.26
1. Finished implementing Agent.strategyUpdate
2. Finished implementing PlayPDG.initializeNetwork

Ziya&James 6.27
1. Finished implementing calculatePayoffs

Ziya&James 6.28
1. Move strategyUpdate to PlayPDG class
2. Finish implement ifEquilibrium
\Install Pajek on lab machine
2. Testing and debug: input graph into a visualizer and see our result 

TODO:
1. output network to text file
2. visialize network in Pajek or something else
3. run test cases of different tolerance parameters 0.05, 0.10, 0.15, 0.20....->goal is to have graph
4. compare results with cascading failure paper to see if our code is correct
5. brainstorm our expected results so that we know if our code is working properly
