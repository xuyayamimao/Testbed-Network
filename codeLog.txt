Ziya&James 6.28
1. Install Pajek on lab machine
2. Testing and debug: input graph into a visualizer and see our result

TODO:
1, Create network into a txt file, ->txt file format output can be used for software to visualize it
2, Run cases for test(different value of alpha, etc.) -> create visualization for the results
3, always keep track of percentage of agents eliminated
4, percentage of cooperators left in network (in cooperator cluster)  -Amount of clusters left?
5, pick colors for cooperator and defector
6, use small network first to test the code
7,Done the coding part by Tuesday and start testing and run test cases after testing
